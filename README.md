# ROT-13-and-Caesar-Cipher-encryption-and-decryption
This Python script provides a simple yet powerful tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using two popular ciphers: Caesar Cipher and ROT-13. It allows users to interactively choose their preferred encryption method and input messages for secure encoding and decoding.
Features
Caesar Cipher:
Encrypts messages by shifting each letter by a user-specified value.
Decrypts the encrypted message using the same shift value.
ROT-13:
A specialized cipher that shifts letters by 13 places.
Automatically decrypts messages using the same function, as ROT-13 is its own inverse.
How It Works
Choose Encryption Method:

User selects between Caesar Cipher and ROT-13.
Input Message:

Enter the message to be encrypted.
For Caesar Cipher:

Specify the shift value (a number) for encryption.
Results:

Displays the original message, encrypted message, and decrypted message.
